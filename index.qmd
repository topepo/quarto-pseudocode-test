# Introduction

Adopting [Christophe Dervieux's Rmd instructions](https://rpubs.com/cderv/pseudocodejs) to get algorithms in to Quarto HTML documents. 

Using `r R.version.string`, Quarto `r system("quarto --version", intern = TRUE)`, and RStudio IDE 2023.3.0.34.


## Setup: 

His steps: 

1. Add an HTML file to include in the `_quarto.yml`.
1. Add a `js` code block


```{js}
#| echo: false
#| label: js-include-algorithm
window.addEventListener('load', (event) => {
  elem = document.querySelectorAll(".algorithm")
  elem.forEach(e => {
    pseudocode.renderElement(e, {lineNumber: true, lineNumberPunc: ' '});
  })
});
```

*issue 1*: `js` block prompts me for a jupyter install: 

```
Starting python3 kernel...Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Applications/quarto/share/jupyter/jupyter.py", line 21, in <module>
    from notebook import notebook_execute, RestartKernel
  File "/Applications/quarto/share/jupyter/notebook.py", line 16, in <module>
    import nbformat
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'nbformat'
Python 3 installation:
  Version: 3.8.9
  Path: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/python3
  Jupyter: (None)

Jupyter is not available in this Python installation.
Install with python3 -m pip install jupyter
```

It doesn't do that in another repo where I used this. 

Weirdly, once I re-rendered that other repo, this one worked ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

## The algorithm code

Here's an example from the post: 

```{.algorithm}
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{The original \textsf{Relief} algorithm for ranking predictor variables in classification models with two classes.}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE Initialize the predictor scores $S_j$ to zero;
\FOR{$i = 1\ldots m$ randomly selected training set samples ($R_i$)}
\STATE Find the nearest miss and hit in the training set;
\FOR{$j = 1\ldots p$ predictor variables}
   \STATE Adjust the score for each predictor  based on the proximity of $R_j$ to the nearest miss and hit:\\
   $S_j = S_j - diff_j(R_j, Hit)^2/m + diff_j(R_j, Miss)^2/m$;
\ENDFOR
\ENDFOR
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

(nothing shows up in the HTML output)

*issue 2*: (In another document) this same code renders but the LaTeX is not processed: 

```{r}
#| label: bad-algo
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 100%

knitr::include_graphics("algo-output.png")
```
